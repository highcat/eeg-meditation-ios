Using only `MWMSdk`. It's enough to get meditation data & bands. AlgoSdk framework is not needed.

# TODO

* Logic
* Display graph in Real-time - partially, e.g. last 2 minutes
* Test on iPhone 11 with BlueTooth 5 - ask someone in coworking space?
* Settings screen
    * "beta" function: data upload URL & "ask Alex Lokk for access"
    * graph
* Welcome screen
* Help / description for screen overlay
* Save meditations data to CoreData?
