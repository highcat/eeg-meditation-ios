# EEG Meditation for iOS

A meditation meter & trainer for those who strive for serious results.
It utilizes an electroencephalogram (EEG) headset to detect brain waves.

Compatible headsets by NeuroSky:
* Mindwave Mobile 2 (2018)
* Mindwave Mobile+ (2016)
* Mindwave Mobile (2011)

These headsets are chosen as the best quality and most affordable. Initially, we've used an internal headset's algorithm, but the latest release contains our own, "honest" recognition formula. Since this time the app can be extended further to use different headsets.

# Features

* Meditation recognition: our own Formula, legacy NeuroSky algorithm. The former is best for serious meditation. The latter provides handicap and is intended for games. Choose & compare!
* Guru Mode to reach deeper levels. 20 points harder. Our evangelist uses it.
* Internal clock, to consolidate multiple signals into one dataset.
* Sound feedback.
* Feedback threshold levels.
* Session timer.
* Distraction counter: tap screen each time you are distracted. Works even without a headset.
* Headset settings. Filter wall power noise: 50 Hz or 60 Hz.

# Technology
The app supports older iPhones & iPads, starting from iOS 10. Thus, UIKit is utilized.

Some RxSwift is used, but not much. Design patterns & structured code.
